Analysis on a Food Delivery Cost data where the parameters are:-
'Order ID','Customer ID','Restaurant ID','Order Date and Time','Delivery Date and Time','Order Value','Delivery Fee','Payment Method','Discounts and Offers','Commission Fee','Payment Processing Fee','Refunds/Chargebacks'

**Objective**
The objective of this code is to analyze and compute the profitability of a food delivery service by processing and examining transaction data. The aim is to understand how various components, such as delivery fees, discounts, and payment processing fees, contribute to the overall costs and profits of the business. By visualizing these cost components, the analysis seeks to provide insights into how to optimize profitability and offer strategic recommendations for enhancing financial performance.

**Data Analysis**
The code performs several key data processing and analysis tasks, each contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the dataset:

_Data Loading and Initial Inspection:_

Load CSV Data: The dataset is read from a CSV file named food delivery costs.csv using Pandas.
Datetime Conversion: Convert 'Delivery Date and Time' and 'Order Date and Time' columns to datetime objects for accurate time-based analysis.
Missing Values Check: Identify and count any missing values across columns to ensure data quality and completeness.
_Data Cleaning and Transformation:_

Discount Extraction: Use a custom function extract_number to isolate numerical values from the 'Discounts and Offers' column, replacing missing values with 0 for further calculations.
Percentage Removal: Convert discount percentages to decimal form for mathematical operations using the remove_percentage function, ensuring consistent data representation.
Conditional Calculations: Compute 'Total Discount' using the np.where function, applying the discount as a percentage of 'Order Value' only if the discount value is less than 15; otherwise, use the discount value directly.
_Profit and Cost Calculations:_

Cost Calculation: Sum up 'Delivery Fee,' 'Total Discount,' and 'Payment Processing Fee' to derive the total 'Costs' for each transaction.
Profit Calculation: Calculate 'Profit' by subtracting total 'Costs' from 'Commission Fee.'
Profitability Assessment: Sum total profit across all transactions to gauge the overall profitability of the delivery service.
_Visualization:_

Cost Distribution: Use a pie chart to visualize the relative distribution of key cost components ('Delivery Fee,' 'Total Discount,' and 'Payment Processing Fee'), providing a visual representation of cost structure and potential areas for optimization.
**Key Insights**
The analysis of the dataset yields several important insights that can drive strategic decision-making for the food delivery business:

_Profitability Evaluation:_

The calculated total profit reveals the overall financial health of the delivery operations, highlighting areas where costs are being effectively managed or where potential inefficiencies might exist.
_Cost Composition Analysis:_

The pie chart visualization offers a clear view of the cost distribution among the main components, helping identify which areas contribute most significantly to overall expenses.
Delivery fees constitute a major portion of the costs, indicating an opportunity for optimization, such as renegotiating delivery partner agreements or implementing cost-effective delivery strategies.
_Discount Impact:_

The conditional discount calculation approach shows how discounts influence total costs, emphasizing the importance of balancing promotional offers with maintaining profitability.
It may be beneficial to refine discount strategies, focusing on those that deliver a high return on investment and customer engagement without substantially eroding profit margins.
_Commission vs. Costs:_

Comparing commission fees against calculated costs helps assess whether the service is achieving desired profit levels, guiding adjustments in fee structures or cost management practices.
_Opportunities for Efficiency:_

Identifying high-cost drivers allows for targeted initiatives to reduce expenses, such as optimizing payment processing systems, renegotiating supplier contracts, or adopting dynamic pricing strategies for delivery services.
_Recommendations for Improvement:_

Based on the insights derived, recommendations could include revising discount policies, exploring alternative delivery models, enhancing operational efficiencies, and leveraging data analytics for more accurate demand forecasting and resource allocation.
